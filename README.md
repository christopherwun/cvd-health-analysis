# Cardiovascular Disease: Prediction and Self-Perception

In today's data-driven world, leveraging advanced analytics has become a valuable means of deciphering subtle patterns and insights within the healthcare industry. This project seeks to explore these possibilities, applied to a vast [dataset on cardiovascular disease (CVD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset), containing records of patients with diverse lifestyles, habits, and diseases.

Our aim is to explore the relationships embedded in this data, in turn answering questions like:


*   How well do patient lifestyles predict their risk of disease?
*   What correlations exist between personal habits, physiological traits, and disease?
*   How well can machine learning models evaluate patient disease outcomes based on self-reported lifestyles?

Additional data on worldwide disease and mortality was combined with CVD data to define multiple custom health metrics. These were used to compare an objective measure of health against patient self-evaluation, and to reveal insights into how accurate patients were in perceiving their own health.

Finally, a variety of predictive modeling techniques were applied, evaluated, and compared against each other to shed light on the potential of machine learning in the healthcare industry.

The project demonstrates the powerful ability of robust predictive models in healthcare. Integration of these kinds of data-driven insights can streamline a multitude of critical aspects, such as hospital productivity, resource allocation, and physician decision making, paving the path toward better healthcare, and a better tomorrow.
